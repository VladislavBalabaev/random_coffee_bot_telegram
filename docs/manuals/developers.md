# Notes for Developers

## Setup

See the [recommended VS Code extensions](recommended_vscode_extensions.md) for a better dev experience.

### Via Local Environment

Being in repository directory:

```bash
python -m venv venv
vim venv/bin/activate
# Then add line at the end of file: export PYTHONPATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/../src"

source venv/bin/activate

pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Pre-Commit Actions

### Format & Lint

```bash
black src/ tests/

ruff check src/ tests/ --fix
```

### Type Check

```bash
mypy src/
```

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Launch Bot

Be sure to have `.env` file similar to `.env.example`

Being in repository directory:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker

docker compose build #--no-cache
docker compose up --detach

docker compose stop
docker compose down
```

Note that the bot started in docker _synchronizes_ Postgres DB & logs with local directory via channeling.

You can view logs from docker via:

```bash
docker compose logs -f bot
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose logs -f db
```

## Scripts

### To work with ChatGPT

Simple recursive script to walk through files and concatenate their contents with headers.

```bash
python scripts/combine_files.py
```

Additionally, you can use `tree` to show ChatGPT project's structure:

```bash
tree src/nespresso/
tree -I '.vscode|__pycache__|*cache|venv|logs|postgres_data|code_combined.txt|try' --prune
```

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to the project!  
Here's how to get started â€” both through GitHub and your terminal.

### GitHub Setup

1. Fork the repository  
   Visit [the main repo](https://github.com/VladislavBalabaev/random_coffee_bot_telegram) and click **"Fork"** (top-right corner).

2. Clone your fork

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/random_coffee_bot_telegram.git
   cd random_coffee_bot_telegram
   ```

3. Add the original repo as `upstream`

   This keeps your fork in sync with the source:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/VladislavBalabaev/random_coffee_bot_telegram.git
   ```

4. Check remotes

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

Happy contributing! ðŸ’™
